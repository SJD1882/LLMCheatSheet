## Intro

This is a personal GitHub repository for stashing resources on Large Language Models (LLM), which will at the very least include the following:

- Curated list of the latest open source LLMs (Vanilla HuggingFace, GPTQ, GGML for llama.cpp)
- Code implementation of open source finetuned LLMs (e.g. Vicuna, OpenAssistant, WizardLM, etc.)
- LLMs Applications with Langchain (e.g. plugins, documment summarization, story writing, etc.)
- Analysis of finetuned datasets (e.g. ShareGPT, WizardLM, OpenAssistant, etc.)
- Survey of research literature on LLM

Resources on this repository are of free of use with no restrictions.
